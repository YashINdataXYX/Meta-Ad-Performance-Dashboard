# Meta-Ad-Performance-Dashboard 


📊 Overview
An interactive Power BI Dashboard built to analyze the performance of Meta (Facebook & Instagram) advertising campaigns.
The dashboard provides a complete funnel view — from impressions and clicks to conversions and ROI — helping marketing teams uncover performance trends, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

-Identified conversion drop-off of 0.61%, leading to targeted landing-page optimizations.

-Enabled budget reallocation toward high-performing ad types and audiences.

-Enhanced campaign ROI through data-backed targeting and scheduling strategies.
